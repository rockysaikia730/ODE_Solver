\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
A class representing an ordinary differential equation (\doxylink{class_o_d_e}{ODE}). 

This class encapsulates the properties and methods related to ODEs, including their initial conditions, the defining function, and the necessary parameters for numerical solving, done using a Solver class. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
