\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Definition of the abstract base class for ODE Solvers. 

This file defines the generic interface for solving Ordinary Differential Equations. Concrete implementations (e.\+g., \doxylink{class_forward_euler}{Forward\+Euler}, Runge\+Kutta4) should inherit from this class and implement the Step() method.
